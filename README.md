cargomedia-website
==================

Company website - http://www.cargomedia.ch/

Prismic CMS
-----------

The website loads content from a Prismic-CMS account.

To add a **team member**, go to https://cargomediach.prismic.io/documents/working/ and press `New` button. Select `Team Member` type. Fill in the created item. Save and publish it. Now it's done. Congratulations!

Jekyll Blog
-----------

Blogposts are stored in this repository and rendered with Jekyll.

- All posts are stored in the `_posts/` folder
- Images from posts are stored in the `img/posts/[year]/` folder

- Add a file with naming convention date-title.markdown (e.g. `2013-2-22-New-Post.markdown`) into `_posts/`
- Add post meta information (YAML), followed by markdown
- Use `<!--more-->` to slice your blogpost (only the content above is shown in preview mode)
- Include images using e.g `![Image Title](/img/posts/2013/customImage.jpg)`
- Include code using [Liquid](http://docs.shopify.com/themes/liquid-basics) syntax

Development
-----------

Install dependencies
```
bundle install
npm install
```

Build the site and serve it on http://localhost:4000:
```
grunt develop
```
â€¦this will also watch for changes, rebuild and trigger a *live reload*.

Docker container
----------------

There's a docker container to run Jekyll in.
This should be removed in the future if possible.

- install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
- run `docker-compose up` in this repo

You should have the website running on `http://localhost:4000` normally :)
