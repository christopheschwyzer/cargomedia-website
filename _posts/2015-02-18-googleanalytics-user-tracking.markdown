Google Analytics' new *Universal Analytics* tracks [User IDs](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/user-id) and therefore allows to connect multiple sessions (even across devices) from the same user.

Additionally it's now possible to collect data over GA's new HTTP API [*Measurement Protocol*](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/v1/).
One can send POST requests to a URL to track *page views*, *events*, *e-commerce* etc.

This allows one to track events for users that happen independently of any user interaction!

Imagine you bill your customers monthly for using your application. In the instant when the payment happens the user might not be using the application.
Nevertheless you can send a POST request to Google Analytics to collect an e-commerce transaction.

Universal Analytics knows the two parameters `cid` (*clientId*) to identify a session by its cookie, and `uid` (*userId*) to identify a user by your application's user-id.
The `cid` is a required parameter, and `uid` is optional.

How does GA handle such server-side sent hits? To find out the details I went ahead and sent some *events* to the REST API:

- Example6: This event sent a `uid` and a `cid` that were both also used to browse the site with normal `analytics.js`.
- Example7: This event sent a `uid` that was used with browsing the site, but a `cid` that was *made up*.

Both events were tracked properly, and assigned to the same user:

It's important to notice that GA will treat the server sending the events as a normal client. It will use its Browser, Location etc (although you can override that with additional parameters):

The new *Measurement Protocol* is very powerful, and allows for use cases that were not previously possible.
One can send an arbitrary (unique) session/cookie identifier, and use the *userId* to actually identify the user.

Next we will try to find out whether such `uid`-identified events can be used as goals for *AdWords Optimizer*â€¦
