title: Task - Denkmal Radio
---

<p>This task is about creating a concept for adding an "Internet Radio" to <a href="http://www.denkmal.org">Denkmal.org</a>. With this task we'd like to see a candidate's ability to design a tiny application, and how to integrate it in a larger context.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Denkmal.org is a an open-source side-project part of the company is contributing to. It's a Basel-based event-calendar with the ability to pre-listen to an event's music. The application follows the mobile-first philosophy. We now would like to add a simple Radio to the app.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We need an indication (button, link, etc.), on the landing page, that there is a radio</li>
  <li>A radio interface with a playlist (You're only able to skip, or go to a certain song)</li>
  <li>Think flexible and mobile-first - the design needs to adjust to the available space (different screen sizes)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Visit <a href="http://www.denkmal.org">Denkmal.org</a> and have a look at what's already there.</li>
  <li>Think about what elements and functionalities need to be included</li>
  <li>Make at least two drafts (One for the integration on the landing page, one for the radio interface)</li>
</ul>

<p class="solitary">We hope you have fun working on this mini-project and are looking forward to examine your solution.</p>
